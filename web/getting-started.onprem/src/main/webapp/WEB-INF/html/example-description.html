<p>This example demonstrates the use of the Pipeline API to perform
    IP Intelligence lookups in a simple Web Application servlet project.
<p>In particular, it highlights
    <ol><li>Automatic processing of IP addresses from HTTP requests;</li>
    <li>Custom IP address lookup via form input;</li>
    <li>Display of location, network registration, and geographic data.</li></ol>
<p>The example <code>GettingStartedWebOnPrem</code> uses on-premise IP Intelligence
    data files for fast, local processing without external API calls.
<p>This example demonstrates use of the PipelineFilter, configured via
    the <code>web.xml</code> and pipeline options <code>51Degrees-OnPrem.xml</code>
    files, to create a pipeline using on-premise IP Intelligence.
